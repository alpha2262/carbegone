Time2Go ReadMe:

About: For trips around cities there are often many movement options (e.g. walk, bike, drive, etc.). The preferences for the trip, such as bad weather or running late, influence the trip mode, yet most routing tools make consumers approach their needs in the opposite way: what mode do you want to use then decide how long will it take to get there. Time2Go takes user constraints/preferences into account, then recommends mode shares.
