app planning:
* rails? firebase?
* add in jasmine tests
* angular or react front end?

app inclusion pseduo APIs:
* google maps - use for everything then hack answers
* cap bikeshare based on time: using google maps and divide out based on time
* car2go: price per minute or $10/hr whichever is lower
* uber pricing per miles: check several short to long distances, set price based on closest distance
* mobile ready?

business logic:
* lower barriers to cutting the cord on their car
* 30 day no-car challenge?
* use generic car cost w/ custom input option
* calculator to see if car-free makes sense for individual
* payments by developers to downscale number of cars in neighborhood in exchange for lower parking requirements
* end goal is to show savings through no car insurance, etc.

Revenue logic:
* amazon referral buys?
* car2go, etc. referrals
* percentage of savings from no longer having a car

business challenges:
* convince ppl they don't immediately need a car and savings are worth it
* profitable app? take % savings or % fee of payments to uber, etc.?


API tie-ins (each as a separate module/feature):
* uber
* zipcar
* car2go

include? or use another routing app?
* wmata rail
* wmata bus (separate APIs)
* capital bikeshare
* DC circulator, ART, etc.
* WalkScore (seems to be a fee-based API; avoid for now)


stats:
* average family spends $900/month per car
* 60 percent of the total population who describe themselves as “interested but concerned” about biking. Of those, 80 percent would be willing to ride on streets with a separated or protected bike lane. https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/nacto-survey-protected-bike-lanes-safety-equity
